# Fire Fighting Bot

A Firefighting robot is designed and built with an embedded system. It is capable of navigating alone on a modeled floor while actively scanning the flames of fire. This robot is designed in such a way that it searches a fire, & douses it before the fire could spread out of range & control. The robot is conrolled by remote operation using RF Technology. This robot is loaded with a water tanker and a pump controlled through wireless communication to sprinkle water. For the desired operation, an 8051 microcontroller is used.

## Components Used

1. 8051 Microcontroller
2. Robot body
3. Water tanker and pump
4. DC Motors
5. Wireless Camera

## The Project

At the transmitter end, push buttons are used to send commands to the receiver end to control the robotic movement, either in forward, backward, right or left direction. The RF transmitter acts as an RF remote control that has the benefit of adequate range up to 200 meters with apposite antenna, while the decoder decode before feeding it to another microcontroller to drive DC motors via motor driver IC for necessary work.
A water tank with pump is placed on the robot body and its operation is carried out from the microcontroller o/p through the proper signal from the transmitting end. The entire operation is controlled by a microcontroller. A motor driver IC is interfaced to the microcontroller through which the controller drives the motors.
A wireless camera is used, so that the robot can be controlled remotely.
